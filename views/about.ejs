          <h4> Hey there, my name is Christian Lane, and I'm the guy who made this site! That's me on 
          the right there. </h4>
          <br><br>
          <h4>The goal of this site is to allow users to create an account where they
          can store pictures of the various pieces of clothing that they
          have in their closet. </h4>
          <br><br>
          <h4>I've had this idea in mind for a while now, I pitched it to my team during my software engineering course in my
          undergraduate studies, but we decided to go with a different project at the time. Now, after graduating, I decided
          to work on the project on my own, both to improve my skills, and to actually make a product I plan on using!</h4>

           At the moment, the project is in very early stages, with no user
          accounts and only a few static images of shirts and pants on the site.
          <br>
          My plan for the future is to add places to store hats, shoes, accessories, etc!
          <br><br>
          Update 10/9/20: <br> User accounts are now live! You can create an account
          and sign in, which you must do to be able to view the Clothing page. At the moment
          , there are only a few pieces of clothing that are the same for everyone. <br>
          The next thing I'll be working on is giving the users the ability to upload pictures
          of their own clothes, which will replace what you see on the Clothing page now.
          <br><br>
          Update 10/20/20: <br> Users can now upload a picture of clothing to their own account. The 
          piece can be either a piece of bottom wear, such as pants, or upper wear, like a shirt. Users
          can see all of their uploaded pieces on the clothing page, and they can also delete any piece they
          no longer want on the site. 
          <br><br>
          Update: 10/26/20: <br> Outfits are live! Users can now select a piece of clothing from each category that they 
          want to match together, and create an outfit with them. After selecting each piece and hitting "Save this outfit"
          on the clothing page, users can view their outfits in one place on the outfits page.
