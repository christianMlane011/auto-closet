        <h4>Hey there, my name is Christian Lane, and I'm terrible at knowing
          which of my clothes should go with the others. Kind of throwing myself
          under the bus here huh? Well, that's why I made this site!
          <br><br>
          The goal of this site is to allow users to create an account where they
          can store pictures of the various pieces of clothing that they
          have in their closet. 
          <br><br>
          I've had this idea in mind for a while now, I pitched it to my team during my software engineering course in my
          undergraduate studies, but we decided to go with a different project at the time. Now, after graduating, I decided
          to work on the project on my own, both to improve my skills, and to actually make a product I plan on using!

          At the moment, the project is in very early stages, with no user
          accounts and only a few static images of shirts and pants on the site.
          <br><br>
          My plan for the future is to add places to store hats, shoes, accessories, etc!
